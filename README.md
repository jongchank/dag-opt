# dag-opt

To build
```
$ cmake .
$ make
```
Executable files opt4, opt5, opt6 are for four runnable DAGs, five runnable DAGs, and six runnable DAGs, respectively. Executable sopt is a universal optimizer for general DAGs with arbitrary number of runnables. Note sopt is much slower than the original optN programs.
